# House-Value
House value prediction

Using fundamental attributes of a house, predict the house value.  The baseline notebook was developed using data from California, referencing the text, "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow", by Aurélien Géron.  The constructs of the notebook adhere to the data science modeling methodology, incorporating maps from follium, however, the objective is to illustrate the model results without performing feature engineering, demonstrating that best practices are essential else the final outcome varies significantly from the expected.
